This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
MyData <- read.csv("MyData.csv")
str(MyData)
```
1) Noticing that there is a region called "TotalUS", how many small Hass avocados (PLU 4046) of type conventional were sold on average during 2015-2018? Of type organic?
Repeat for PLU 4225 and PLU 4770. Comment on the sales of conventional avocados vs organic.
```{r}
TotalUS <- subset(MyData, region == 'TotalUS', 
                  select = c("PLU4046","PLU4225","PLU4770","type","month","year","day"))
str(TotalUS)
```

```{r}
#average sales of PLU4046
tapply(TotalUS$PLU4046, TotalUS$type, mean)

#average sales of PLU4225
tapply(TotalUS$PLU4225, TotalUS$type, mean)

#average sales of PLU4770
tapply(TotalUS$PLU4770, TotalUS$type, mean)
```
Conventional type has more sale than the Organic type.

```{r}
#monthly sale of conventional Avocados
#subset the type "conventional" avocados from TotalUS dataset

conv <- subset(TotalUS, type == 'conventional' )
summary(conv)
```

```{r}
#boxplot for PLU4046
boxplot(conv$PLU4046 ~ conv$month, main = "Total sale of PLU4046 Avocados each month",
        ylab = "Total sale", xlab = "Month")
```
We see an outlier in the month of February. The exact day was found out to be February 2nd , 2017: The day of Super Bowl. (No doubt people LOVE chips and Guacamole).
```{r}
#boxplot for PLU4225
boxplot(conv$PLU4225 ~ conv$month, main = "Total sale of PLU4225 Avocados each month",
        ylab = "Total sale", xlab = "Month")
```
Though we don't see outlier for PLU4225 in the month of February but we have maximum sale in this month. We can say that Guaocamole is the favorite dip/spread with the chips/tacos and people enjoy this food while watching the game.
```{r}
boxplot(conv$PLU4770 ~ conv$month, main = "Total sale of PLU4770 Avocados each month",
        ylab = "Total sale", xlab = "Month")
```
```{r}
#Finding a correlation between average price and total volume of avocados sold
cor(MyData$Total.Volume,MyData$AveragePrice)

```
There is a negative correlation between the total Avocados sold and the average price of the Avocados.
When the average price is less, the sale is more.
```{r}
mean(MyData$Total.Volume)
```

```{r}
mean(MyData$AveragePrice)
```

```{r}
hist(MyData$AveragePrice,xlab="Average Price",main ="Frequency of Average Price")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
